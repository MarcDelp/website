# About
This is my personal website. Visit it [here](https://marc-delpech.pagesperso-orange.fr/).  
The purpose of this site is only to have my own demo website and to keep practicing React.  
Feel free to inspire yourself from what I have done. It's pretty simple, but I hope you'll still find some interest in it.
